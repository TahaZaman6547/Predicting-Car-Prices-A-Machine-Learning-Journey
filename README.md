Reporting & Insights – Summary Report

Summary of Findings

#### **Key Insights from EDA on Car Prices**
- **Technical Specs Drive Price**: Features like **engine-size**, **horsepower**, and **curb-weight** are positively correlated with price, highlighting performance and luxury appeal.
- **Brand Impact**: Premium brands (e.g., **BMW**, **Mercedes-Benz**) dominate higher price ranges, while economy brands (e.g., **Chevrolet**, **Honda**) remain budget-friendly.
- **Fuel Efficiency Trade-off**: Cars with high **city-mpg** and **highway-mpg** usually have **lower prices**, reflecting a trade-off between performance and economy.
- **Body Style Influence**: **Convertibles** and **hardtops** tend to be priced higher than **sedans** and **hatchbacks**, revealing aesthetic and luxury preferences.
- **Data Challenges**: Fields like **normalized-losses** contained missing or noisy values (‘?’), requiring **imputation and cleanup** for reliable modeling.

### **Most Influential Features in Price Prediction**
- **Top Predictors**:  
  1. **Engine Size**  
  2. **Horsepower**  
  3. **Curb Weight**  
  4. **Brand (Make)**  
  5. **Aspiration Type** (e.g., turbocharged)

- **Least Important**:  
  Features like **number of doors** and **fuel type** had minimal effect on price.

### **Challenges During Preprocessing & Modeling**
- **Missing & Inconsistent Data**: Handled using **median** for numerical and **mode** for categorical features.
- **Encoding Categorical Variables**: Used **one-hot** and **label encoding** for features like `make` and `drive-wheels`.
- **Feature Scaling**: Applied normalization for better model balance, especially for **Linear Regression**.
- **Model Issues**:  
  - **Overfitting** in tree models resolved through **hyperparameter tuning**.  
  - **Interpretability** of complex models like Random Forest addressed using **feature importance plots**.

### **Scaling to Larger Datasets**
To handle more complex datasets:
1. **Feature Engineering**: Introduce interaction terms or new variables like vehicle age.
2. **Dimensionality Reduction**: Use **PCA** or **t-SNE** to reduce noise and redundancy.
3. **Model Optimization**: Apply **GridSearchCV**, **RandomizedSearch**, or **Bayesian Optimization**; experiment with models like **XGBoost**, **LightGBM**, or **DNNs**.
4. **Feature Selection**: Use **RFE** or **SHAP values** for scalable and interpretable modeling.
5. **Data Augmentation**: Generate synthetic samples for rare or underrepresented classes.
6. **Pipeline Automation**: Employ tools like **Pipeline** and **ColumnTransformer** to automate preprocessing and ensure reproducibility.
